# pico8websitemaker
It makes a website for PICO-8 games.
This is a little tool I put together to create a PICO-8 game website.<br>
      To add a game, you must enter in all the information for it, press 'Add game', and voila! A game<br>
      has been added. To actually have this work, you need to put the game.html and game.js files in the same directory. Then it will work fine.<br><br>

      To put this on the web, I would reccomend <a href='https://github.com'>Github</a> and <a href='https://netlify.app'>Netlify.</a><br>
      Put all the files into Github (I expect you know how, but <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world">heres a tutorial</a>), then go to Netlify and add a new <br>site. Press 'Import from an existing project,' sign in to github, and select the repo you <br>want to put on the web. Then, you can press Deploy Site at the bottom of the page.<br> Then, you press 'Domain settings,' and go to Custom Domains, and press 'Options' on the current one. <br>Edit it to whatever you want. To have a .com name (or .net, or whatever), you need some money<br>(I'm not going to put a tutorial for that here).
